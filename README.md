## üöÄ Quick Start

### **1. Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **2. Scrape YC Data**
```bash
# Step 1: Extract company URLs (requires Firefox/Chrome)
python yc_links_extractor.py

# Step 2: Run the scraper
cd scrapy-project
scrapy crawl YCombinatorScraper

# Output will be saved to data/yc_companies.jl
```

### **3. Set Up OpenAI API (Optional)**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'
```

### **4. Run the Analysis**
```python
# Open the analysis notebook
jupyter lab analysis/genai_enhanced_analysis.ipynb

# Or run specific analyses
python -c "from analysis.genai_enhanced_analysis import *; create_executive_summary()"
```

### **5. Try These Examples**
```python
# Get portfolio overview
create_executive_summary()

# Analyze a specific year
quick_year_analysis(2023)

# Get AI insights for a company
analyze_company_interactive(company_name='Airbnb')

# Market intelligence
quick_market_analysis()

# Personalized recommendations
get_personalized_recommendations(founder_type='solo', industry='AI')
```

## üï∑Ô∏è Data Scraping

### **Step 1: Extract Company URLs**
```bash
# First, extract all company URLs from YC website
python yc_links_extractor.py

# This will create scrapy-project/ycombinator/start_urls.txt
# with all company URLs for scraping
```

### **Step 2: Run the Scraper**
```bash
# Navigate to scraper directory
cd scrapy-project

# Run the scraper
scrapy crawl YCombinatorScraper

# Output will be saved to data/yc_companies.jl
```

### **Complete Scraping Workflow**
```bash
# 1. Extract URLs (requires Firefox/Chrome)
python yc_links_extractor.py

# 2. Run the scraper
cd scrapy-project
scrapy crawl YCombinatorScraper

# 3. Check output
ls -la data/yc_companies.jl
```

### **Advanced Scraping Options**
```bash
# Custom output file
scrapy crawl YCombinatorScraper -s FEEDS='data/custom_companies.jl'

# Limit number of companies
scrapy crawl YCombinatorScraper -s CLOSESPIDER_PAGECOUNT=100

# Run with custom settings
scrapy crawl YCombinatorScraper -s DOWNLOAD_DELAY=1 -s RANDOMIZE_DOWNLOAD_DELAY=0.5
```

### **Scraping Configuration**
```python
# Customize scraping in scrapy-project/ycombinator/settings.py
DOWNLOAD_DELAY = 1
RANDOMIZE_DOWNLOAD_DELAY = 0.5
CONCURRENT_REQUESTS = 16
ROBOTSTXT_OBEY = True
AUTOTHROTTLE_ENABLED = True
AUTOTHROTTLE_START_DELAY = 5
```

### **Troubleshooting Scraping**
```bash
# If URL extraction fails:
# 1. Check Firefox is installed
# 2. Update webdriver-manager: pip install --upgrade webdriver-manager
# 3. Check internet connection

# If scraper fails:
# 1. Check start_urls.txt exists and has URLs
# 2. Verify scrapy is installed: pip install scrapy
# 3. Check robots.txt compliance

# Common issues:
# - "GeckoDriver not found": webdriver-manager will auto-install
# - "No URLs found": Check YC website structure hasn't changed
# - "Rate limited": Increase DOWNLOAD_DELAY in settings.py
```
